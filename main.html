    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as a function of its input size. In other words, it quantifies the amount of time an algorithm requires to solve a problem. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity grows at a slower rate compared to the size of the input. This ensures that the algorithm remains practical even for larger datasets, allowing for quicker problem-solving.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a problem based on its input size. It is a crucial consideration, especially in memory-constrained environments. One common way to express space complexity is using the notation 'O(n)', where 'n' represents the size of the input. This notation provides an upper bound on the growth of memory usage as the input size increases. <b>Space Complexity</b> helps us assess how much memory an algorithm needs to store temporary data, variables, and other data structures during its execution.</p>
